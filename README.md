# Eye-Movement
## Description 
In this cursor detection program, two eyes follow your mouse's movement. While the structure of the eyes is stagnant, the pupils respond by moving within them.
## How to Run
To use this program, download eyes.js, styles.css, and index.html into the same directory. Open index.html in your preferred browser. 
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
More facial features may be added. Perhaps one day this will be a robot and I will be God, but hopefully not, because that seems like a lot of unnessesary work.
